# JavaScript Drum Kit
This is a simple JavaScript Drum Kit application that allows you to play different drum sounds using your keyboard. When you press specific keys on your keyboard, corresponding drum sounds will be played. I created this as a way to play around with JavaScript and also incorporate a cool animated background using CSS.

## How to Use

Use the app via the [Live Link](https://mattoz.github.io/JavaScript-Drum-Kit/)

To run the app on your local machine:

Clone or download the project.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Press any of these keys on your keyboard to play the corresponding drum sound. Each key press will trigger a visual effect on the drum pad.
